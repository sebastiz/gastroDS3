    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p class="pub-abstract" itemprop="text">Introduction: Most electronically stored endoscopic reports consist of semi-structured free text. containing a significant amount of auditable information. However, the unstandardised text requires cleaning prior to audit so that the data is standardised across patients. One major obstruction to the automated auditing of free text is phrases that mention an absence of a pathology such as ‘No hiatus hernia is seen.’ or ‘There is no malignancy.’ Methods: The current study aims to determine the complexity of semi-structured free text endoscopy reports and determine the simplest function in the globally most popular data analytics language ‘R’, to remove negative phrases from endoscopic text and to validate the performance of this algorithm against manual extraction. Five hundred endoscopic reports were randomly selected for any procedure between Jan 1 2007 to Jan 1 2017. The low average text complexity (measured using the package ‘readability’ in R based on sentence structure rather than terminology) was equivalent to age 14–15 years (Readability scores: Flesch KinCaid=9.8, Gunning_Fog Index=13.3, Coleman_Liau=10.0) meaning that the text could be analysed using less processor intensive pattern recognition defined as ‘regular expressions ‘rather than using machine learning. Negative phrases were extracted from the first 100 reports as a training set, using the ‘lexicon’ package in R by cross referencing each sentence in an endoscopy report with a list of known negators to create generic regular expressions that could detect all negative phrases and incorporated into a script in R. A endoscopist blinded to the automated results was required to remove all negative phrases whether in mixed or non-mixed sentences for the same 400 endoscopy reports.
