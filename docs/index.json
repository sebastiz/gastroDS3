Automating audit can also provide a huge time saving for units and lend itself well to the quality improvements that units strive for without being burdensome. Unfortunately the tools for reproducible and automated audit and research are beyond the skillset for most clinicians as they are not a standard part of clinical training.\nThe Institute therefore has two aims for gastroenterological data analytics training:\nUnderstanding Gastroenterological datasets Gastroenterological datasets are fairly similar to many medical datasets in so far as they as predominantly episode based (as opposed to patient based). The implication is that patient episode identifiers are usually a combination of the patient’s unique identifier and a date.\nOnce this basic tenet of data organisation is understood, much of the downstream analyses are simple to understand. A framework for the understanding of the different analyses types as applied to practical gastroenterology explained here.\nThis framework provides the structure for the published and open source toolwhich analyses endoscopic and pathological datasets according to this conceptual framework.\nUnderstanding the basic analytical tools A lot of large dataset analysis is coded ie. scripted using a coding language. This is a very efficient way to share methodologies and reproduce analyses. Of course the language has to be learnt which requires a learning curve.\nIt is the aim of the Institute to provide basic resources for the practising clinician to learn one of the main data analytics languages – R so that the clinician can create and run his or her own analyses. Some of these resources are already online and through other collaborators such as NHS-R we contribute to the dissemination of tutorials for the practicing clinician.\n","date":1555718400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1555718400,"objectID":"f4dcedb0a8e6bc63a7cff04bfe0fa968","permalink":"/post/dataanalytics/","publishdate":"2019-04-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/dataanalytics/","section":"post","summary":"Training clinicians in formal analytics of medical data to encourage reproducible audit and research.","tags":null,"title":"Data Analytics Training","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"Although the NHS is a National service much electronic data has developed in systems that are not integrated with one another. Consequently there are many datasets in individual fields and departments that cannot be cross-referenced with other datasets because the ability to link data by a common record identifier has not been considered at the inception of the dataset.\nWith the expansion of elecontric data through, for example, the electronic patient record, there has been an increasing interest in data linkage between separate datasets in order to reach more accurate conclusions with bigger datasets.\nAn example of how this is starting to evolve is the use of the Hospital Episode Statistics dataset. This records every patient encounter in the UK whether it be augmented care, outpatients or accident and emergency, with information about various aspects of the care such as diagnosis and therapy. Separately there is a dataset on mortality for all deaths registered in the UK. It is clearly important to link the two datasets and this has now been established, as it has for mental health and other datasets.\nThere are many intracacies when considering how to link data. One of the most important linkages for gastroenterology if that between endoscopy and 30 day mortality and morbidity which may occur at the hospital where the endoscopy was carried out, or another hospital. other examples include linking the IBD registry to the National Endoscopy Database and so on.\nThe Institute is interested in the process of how to standardise datasets and provide guidance for the establishment of new, especially National, datastes to maximise the opportunity to link with other datasets and maximise the robust conclusions about patient care this type of linkage will create.\nA good resource for NHS datasets can be found here\n","date":1555718400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1555718400,"objectID":"e810fdf21d4e3fbae38891c395844c6b","permalink":"/post/datasetlinkage/","publishdate":"2019-04-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/datasetlinkage/","section":"post","summary":"Determining publically available datasets and how to link them to power patient focussed studies","tags":null,"title":"Data Set Linkage and Resources","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" There are many clinical questions to answer in gastroenterology using different datasets so software that facilitates this will come is several forms.

This gives the community the opportunity to see what a typical endoscopy or pathology report might look like so that analyses can be based on real world examples.\nSynthetic datasets There are two versions of synthetic endoscopy data. The first is free text and relates to a complete endoscopic report found often on older software versions before the development of the National Endoscopy Database. This can be found [here](https://github.com/sebastiz/FakeEndoReports\nThis dataset will also generate pathology reports that are relevant to the endoscopy report that has been generated. Pathology reports related to tissue taken at endoscopy allow a more complete examination of the performance of the endoscopic procedure.\nThe second synthetic dataset contains the endoscopy report only and is based on the National Endoscopy Database (NED) data collection framework.

Endoscopic data in the UK is almost exclusively electronic. Pathology reporting of specimens taken at endoscopy is also electronic.Although the data is digitalized much of it is captured in natural language, semi-structured formats. Furthermore pathology datasets are often stored separately to endoscopic datasets so that the merging a pathology report to a specific patients endoscopy date can be difficult. As a result, the data for one of the best validated indicators of endoscopic quality, the adenoma detection rate (ADR), is often done manually, and often inaccurately extrapolated from the endoscopy report only.Automated extraction from text has become simplified using natural language tools. EndoMineR (LINK) is an open source software package written in R and is specifically designed to automate the process of extracting  data from endoscopic and pathology datasets. Furthermore the package merges endoscopic and pathologic datasets by patient and (fuzzy) date and allows downstream analyses that depend on the merge between both datasets, such as the adenoma detection rate. Aim: To determine the sensitivity and specificity of adenoma detection rates when using an automated process  (EndoMineR) when compared to manual extraction.Method: For the manual extraction, the endoscopy reporting database was used to extract reports of all colonoscopic examinations carried out between July 1st 2017 and January 1st 2018 at St Thomas’ Hospital.  If the report mentioned a polypectomy having been performed, the pathology report for that endoscopy was accessed via the electronic patient record to determine whether it was an adenoma. The per endoscopist ADR was the calculated.For the automated extraction, all pathology reports between the dates above were downloaded for all patients who underwent endoscopic examinations between the two dates. EndoMineR managed the merging of pathology and endoscopic reports for each patient at each time point. EndoMineR also extracted all adenomas, including the exclusion of reports mentioning the absence of adenomas, and calculated the per endocopist ADR.Results:Between  July 31st 2017 and Jan 1st 2018 2588 colonoscopies were performed. Endoscopic reports were available for all the endoscopies. Of the 1388 endoscopies where tissue was sent to histopathology, all the pathology reports were available. Manual extraction detected 499 endoscopies where an adenoma was detected and confirmed with histopathology. EndoMineR detected 501. Further examination of the dataset revealed that manual extraction had missed two cases such that the sensitivity and specificity of EndoMineR for this dataset was 100% and 100%. Manual extraction took 4.5 hours. The automated extraction took 5.3 seconds.Conclusion:Automated adenoma detection rates can be calculated from semi-structured text reports accurately using merged endoscopic-pathology records. This technique should also be applicable to the detection of other pathologies detected at endoscopy and therefore has the potential to allow further metric development to assess endoscopic quality.","tags":[],"title":"Automated extraction of endoscopic adenoma detection rates from endoscopic-pathological data is as sensitive and specific as manual extraction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sebastian Zeki"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1372636800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1372636800,"objectID":"7672e455307c75800bd123b41cc3b8fe","permalink":"/publication/endominer/","publishdate":"2013-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/endominer/","section":"publication","summary":"Medical data is increasingly kept in an electronic format worldwide (Bretthauer M. 2016).This serves many purposes including more efficient storage, distribution and accessibility of patient-focussed data. As important is the ability to analyse healthcare data for to optimize resource deployment and usage. The tools for the analysis are often statistical and rely on the provision of ‘clean’ datasets before this can be done. ‘Cleaning’ a dataset is often the most difficult aspect of any data analysis and involves the provision of meaningful and well-formatted data so that the interpretation of the analysis is not subject to the doubts of the data quality. The British Society of Gastroenterology recommends that all endoscopic data is kept in an electronic format particularly to facilitate audit and maintain standards through the Global Rating Scale (GRS) (Stebbing J. 2011). The endoscopic dataset is however only part of the patient’s story as many aspects of a patient’s gastroenterological care depend on the results of histopathological analysis of tissue taken during the examination. Pathology results are often available many days after the endoscopic result and usually stored in a separate data repository, although this may change with the arrival of an encompassing electronic patient record. Regardless of the method of storage, it is often difficult to associate the particular histopathological result with an endoscopic result. Further, even if the two data sets can be merged, a problem occurs in the isolation of various parts of each report such that each part can be individually analysed. Examples include the isolation of who the endoscopist was or the presence of dysplasia within a histopathology report. This is all the more difficult if the report is unstructured or partially structured free text. However if this can be done then many downstream analyses which benefit individual patients as well as the department, can be automated and include more complex analyses to determine follow-up regimes or endoscopic –pathologic lesion recognition performance. The EndoMineR package provides a comprehensive way to extract information from natural language endoscopy ann pathology reports as well as merging the two datasets so that pathology specimens are relevant to the endoscopy they came from. Furthermore the package also provides functions for the following types of analysis of endoscopic and pathological datasets: • 1. Patient surveillance. Examples including determining when patients should return for surveillance and who is overdue. • 2. Patient tracking. -Examples include determining the length of time since the last endoscopy, as well as aggregate functions such as finding how many endoscopies of a certain type have been done and predicting future burden.","tags":[],"title":"EndoMineR for the extraction of endoscopic and associated pathology data from medical reports","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sebastian Zeki"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1372636800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1372636800,"objectID":"959bd80b5788e086a2a92b06aa14bea7","permalink":"/publication/negex/","publishdate":"2013-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/negex/","section":"publication","summary":"Introduction: Most electronically stored endoscopic reports consist of semi-structured free text. containing a significant amount of auditable information. However, the unstandardised text requires cleaning prior to audit so that the data is standardised across patients. One major obstruction to the automated auditing of free text is phrases that mention an absence of a pathology such as ‘No hiatus hernia is seen.’ or ‘There is no malignancy.’ Methods: The current study aims to determine the complexity of semi-structured free text endoscopy reports and determine the simplest function in the globally most popular data analytics language ‘R’, to remove negative phrases from endoscopic text and to validate the performance of this algorithm against manual extraction. Five hundred endoscopic reports were randomly selected for any procedure between Jan 1 2007 to Jan 1 2017. The low average text complexity (measured using the package ‘readability’ in R based on sentence structure rather than terminology) was equivalent to age 14–15 years (Readability scores: Flesch KinCaid=9.8, Gunning_Fog Index=13.3, Coleman_Liau=10.0) meaning that the text could be analysed using less processor intensive pattern recognition defined as ‘regular expressions ‘rather than using machine learning. Negative phrases were extracted from the first 100 reports as a training set, using the ‘lexicon’ package in R by cross referencing each sentence in an endoscopy report with a list of known negators to create generic regular expressions that could detect all negative phrases and incorporated into a script in R. A endoscopist blinded to the automated results was required to remove all negative phrases whether in mixed or non-mixed sentences for the same 400 endoscopy reports. Automated and manually extracted phrases were then statistically compared to generate a sensitivity, specificity and accuracy measurement of automated extraction. The difference in audit outcome was also estimated when a comparison was made between simple keyword searches to populate the audit versus the use of negative removal as implemented using our technique. Results: The training set resulted in 12 regular expressions, compiled into a single runnable function, thought capable of detecting most negative phrases. This resulted in a sensitivity for the detection of negative phrases of 97.2%, specificity 74.61%, positive prediction value of 65.4% and a negative prediction value of 98.01%. When the regular expression function was run against a simple keyword search for certain phrases, certain terms demonstrated a significant difference in their detection when keyword searches were used before and after the negator removal function was used.The term CLO for example was detected 12.25% without negator removal and 7.25% with the function. Conclusions: Given the simple sentence structure of the endoscopy reports across multiple endoscopists, a simple processor-nonintensive approach to the removal of negative or normal findings is feasible. Although there is room to improve the specificity further, it is preferable to have false positives in the output result which may require minimal work to remove in the final data cleaning stage. The removal of negators is likely to have more or less of an impact based on the phrase being searched for.","tags":[],"title":"Removal of normal and negative phrases from endoscopic semi-structured text for accurate automated endoscopic audit","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Welcome to Slides Academic\nFeatures  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides  Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E  Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = \\;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \nA fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears  Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view   Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links   night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links  Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?
