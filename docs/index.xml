      <title>Data Analytics Training</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reproducible research and audit is an important part of day to day gastroenterology. Automating audit can also provide a huge time saving for units and lend itself well to the quality improvements that units strive for without being burdensome. Unfortunately the tools for reproducible and automated audit and research are beyond the skillset for most clinicians as they are not a standard part of clinical training.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Institute therefore has two aims for gastroenterological data analytics training:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;understanding-gastroenterological-datasets&#34;&gt;Understanding Gastroenterological datasets&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gastroenterological datasets are fairly similar to many medical datasets in so far as they as predominantly episode based (as opposed to patient based). The implication is that patient episode identifiers are usually a combination of the patient’s unique identifier and a date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once this basic tenet of data organisation is understood, much of the downstream analyses are simple to understand. A framework for the understanding of the different analyses types as applied to practical gastroenterology explained &lt;a href=&#34;https://sebastiz.github.io/gastrodatascience/CornerstonesIntro.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This framework provides the structure for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://joss.theoj.org/papers/6daff9a9c80c03f1e3c32552b5a7e4f8&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; and open source toolwhich analyses endoscopic and pathological datasets according to this conceptual framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;understanding-the-basic-analytical-tools&#34;&gt;Understanding the basic analytical tools&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of large dataset analysis is coded ie. scripted using a coding language. This is a very efficient way to share methodologies and reproduce analyses. Of course the language has to be learnt which requires a learning curve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the aim of the Institute to provide basic resources for the practising clinician to learn one of the main data analytics languages – R so that the clinician can create and run his or her own analyses. Some of these resources are already online and through other collaborators such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://nhsrcommunity.com/blog/category/r-tips/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;NHS-R&lt;/a&gt; we contribute to the dissemination of tutorials for the practicing clinician.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Data Set Linkage and Resources</title>
      <link>/post/datasetlinkage/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Although the NHS is a National service much electronic data has developed in systems that are not integrated with one another. Consequently there are many datasets in individual fields and departments that cannot be cross-referenced with other datasets because the ability to link data by a common record identifier has not been considered at the inception of the dataset.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the expansion of elecontric data through, for example, the electronic patient record, there has been an increasing interest in data linkage between separate datasets in order to reach more accurate conclusions with bigger datasets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example of how this is starting to evolve is the use of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/data-tools-and-services/data-services/hospital-episode-statistic&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Hospital Episode Statistics dataset&lt;/a&gt;. This records every patient encounter in the UK whether it be augmented care, outpatients or accident and emergency, with information about various aspects of the care such as diagnosis and therapy. Separately there is a dataset on mortality for all deaths registered in the UK. It is clearly important to link the two datasets and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/9981&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this has now been established&lt;/a&gt;, as it has for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/hes-mhldds-data-linkage-report-summary-statistics-sep-2015&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hdf.nihr.ac.uk/getting-ready/linking-sets&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;datasets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many intracacies when considering how to link data. One of the most important linkages for gastroenterology if that between endoscopy and 30 day mortality and morbidity which may occur at the hospital where the endoscopy was carried out, or another hospital. other examples include linking the IBD registry to the National Endoscopy Database and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Institute is interested in the process of how to standardise datasets and provide guidance for the establishment of new, especially National, datastes to maximise the opportunity to link with other datasets and maximise the robust conclusions about patient care this type of linkage will create.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good resource for NHS datasets can be found &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hdf.nihr.ac.uk/datasets/all&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Open Source Data Projects</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are many clinical questions to answer in gastroenterology using different datasets so software that facilitates this will come is several forms. The solutions for problems will often require collaborative efforts between several developers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-open-source&#34;&gt;Why open source?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One aim of the Institute is to create a platform to encourage the collaboration of developers by open sourcing the software. That is to say allowing team building of non-commercial software solutions. The institute has developed a methodology for the development and validation of software for the analysis of datasets and a pipeline that leads to publication for those who have significantly contributed using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ropensci.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;rOpenSci&lt;/a&gt; framework. We hope to incentivise clinical developers by facilitating and encouraging the publication of mature solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open source solutions, in development and being developed, can be found on this publically available &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sebastiz&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;gastro data science&lt;/a&gt; project site. As always we would encourage contributions to these projects:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good example of such a project which was developed as part of the Institute’s programme and is now published, can be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ropensci/EndoMineR&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A tenet of good software development is that it should be collaborative. There is no better way to facilitate this than by making software open source so that the community can contribute.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gastroenterology data sciences institute believes that all the software projects developed under its guidance should be open sourced. Most of these, often with explanatory vignettes, can be found on the Institute’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sebastiz&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt; page and we would encourage you to contribute to all the projects there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of particular interest for the open source community, is the development of synthetic datasets around endoscopy and pathology. This gives the community the opportunity to see what a typical endoscopy or pathology report might look like so that analyses can be based on real world examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;synthetic-datasets&#34;&gt;Synthetic datasets&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two versions of synthetic endoscopy data. The first is free text and relates to a complete endoscopic report found often on older software versions before the development of the National Endoscopy Database. This can be found [here](&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sebastiz/FakeEndoReports&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://github.com/sebastiz/FakeEndoReports&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This dataset will also generate pathology reports that are relevant to the endoscopy report that has been generated. Pathology reports related to tissue taken at endoscopy allow a more complete examination of the performance of the endoscopic procedure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second synthetic dataset contains the endoscopy report only and is based on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ned.jets.nhs.uk/kpi/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;National Endoscopy Database (NED)&lt;/a&gt;  data collection framework. The fields are formatted according to the data that is automatically collected for NED. This work is ongoing and the scripts for the generation of data can be found here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;hospital-episode-statistics&#34;&gt;Hospital Episode Statistics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/data-tools-and-services/data-services/hospital-episode-statistics&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Hospital Episode Statistics&lt;/a&gt; is an anonymised episode level dataset provided via NHS digital that allows the understanding of patient episodes. This has a potential to be linked to other datasets if the data linkage is appropriate. In order to experiment with this dataset and explore the full potential, a further synthetic dataset is in the process of being developed here:&lt;/p&gt;
